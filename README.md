# General

This is a collection of methods to generate molecular features for machine learning, including common feautre representations like coulomb matrix etc. 
Also a graph generator for graph neural networks is found in molreps. This repo is currently under construction and can be easily expandend following this recommended style:
* In molreps the main classes are listed
* In methods individual functions are collected.
* Uses a google-style doc string documentation for each function or class.

# Implementation details

Since there are many chemcial libraries in use, which can not be easily installed with `pip` (that include the following dependencies), they must be installed with e.g. `conda`:
- rdkit, e.g. via `conda install -c rdkit rdkit`
- openbabel, e.g. via `conda install -c openbabel openbabel`

# Usage

## Representations
Simple moleculear representations can be generated from `molreps.descriptors`.

```python
from molreps.descriptors import coulomb_matrix
atoms = ['C','C']
coords = [[0,0,0],[1,0,0]]
cm = coulomb_matrix(atoms,coords)
```

However, also individual function can be used from `molreps.methods`. Like in this case the back-direction.

```python
from molreps.methods.geo_npy import geometry_from_coulombmat
atom_cord = geometry_from_coulombmat(cm)
```

## Graph
For many ML models a graph representation of the molecule is required. The module `MolGraph` from `molreps.graph`
inherits from networkx's `nx.Graph` and can generate a molecular graph based on a mol-object provided by a cheminformatics package like rdkit, openbabel, ase etc. 
This is a flexible way to use functionalities from both networkx and packages like rdkit. First create a mol object.

```python
import rdkit
m = rdkit.Chem.MolFromSmiles("CC1=CC=CC=C1")
m = rdkit.Chem.AddHs(m)
```

The mol object is passed to the MolGraph class constructor but can be further accessed. 

```python
import networkx as nx
import numpy as np
from molreps.graph import MolGraph
mgraph = MolGraph(m)
mgraph.mol  # Access the mol object.
```

The networkx graph is generated by `make()`, where the features and keys can be specified. There are pre-defined features
that can be assigned by an identifier like `'key': 'identifier'` or if further arguments are required by
`'key' : {'class':'identifier', 'args':{'arg1': value1,'arg2': value2 }}`. In the latter case also a custom function or class can be 
provided like `'key' : {'class': my_fun, 'args':{'arg1': value1,'arg2': value2 }}`. A dictionary of predifined identifiers is listed in `print(MolGraph._mols_implemented)`.

```python
mgraph.make()
mgraph.make(nodes = {"proton" : 'proton'},
            edges = {"bond" : 'bond',
                     "distance" : {'class':'distance', 'args':{'bonds_only':True}}},
            state = {"mol_weight" : 'mol_weight'}
            )
```
Note, a custom function must accept `key`,`mol` as arguments and return a list of tuples such as `[(i, {key: property})]`for atoms and `[((i,j, {key: property}))]` for bonds such that it can be read by 
`add_nodes_from()` or `add_edges_from()`, respectively. Then the generated graph can be viewed and treated as a networkx graph, like plotting `nx.draw(mgraph,with_labels=True)`.
Finnaly, a closed form tensor is collected from selected features defined by the key-attribute. 
For each key an additional function to process the features and a default value can be optionally provided but defaults to `np.array`.
A default value has to be added, if a single node or edge is missing a key, to generate a closed form tensor.

```python
mgraph.to_tensor()
graph_tensors= mgraph.to_tensor(nodes = ["proton"],
                                edges = ["bond" ],
                                state = ["mol_weight"],
                                out_tensor = np.array)
```

The returned dictionary containing the feature tensors can be passed to graph models.
